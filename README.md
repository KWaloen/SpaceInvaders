In learning how to use libGDX, I followed this tutorial by Biped Potato: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcdgIkzBRk&t=221

There are similarities in the code as shown in the tutorial but I have made some changes. 
For example: I separated the player and bullet classes and rewrote the classes in a way that makes more sense to me.
